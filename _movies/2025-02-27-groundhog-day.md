## Description
<p>Groundhog Day (Pennsylvania German : Grund'sau d√•k, Grundsaudaag, Grundsow Dawg, Murmeltiertag ; Lunenburg, Nova Scotia : Daks Day) is a tradition observed regionally in the United States and Canada on February 2 of every year. It derives from the Pennsylvania Dutch superstition that if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and sees its shadow, it will retreat to its den and winter will go on for six more weeks; if it does not see its shadow, spring will arrive early. In 2025, the shadow was seen, auguring six more weeks of winter.</p>
